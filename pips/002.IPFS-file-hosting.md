# PIP 002 - IPFS file hosting as-a-service
The scope of this proposal is to suggest an implementation for a web service
that would automate the paid hosting of IPFS data, using BCH as the payment
method. Having an automated IPFS hosting service would enable many other kinds
of apps that need a decentralized, permissionless method of uploading
persistent data that can be retrieved at a later date.

## Workflow
The general workflow for the proposed scheme is as follows:

- An end user would utilize a web UI to select an IPFS hosting provider
from a drop-down list.

- The users browser would make an API call to the selected hosting provider to
upload the file for hosting.

- The hosting server would hash the data and provide it to the IPFS network.
It would return the IPFS retrieval hash and BCH address for payment.

- The users browser would display the BCH address for payment.

- If the payment transaction is not broadcast to the blockchain within a
specified time, the files are deleted.
